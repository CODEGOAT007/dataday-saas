${userName} has added you to their Emergency Support Team on MyDataday - a personal goal achievement app that helps people succeed through social accountability.

Here's what this means:

üéØ WHAT IS MYDATADAY?
MyDataday helps people achieve their goals by creating a support network of people who care about them (like you!).

üë• YOUR ROLE AS EMERGENCY SUPPORT TEAM:
‚Ä¢ You'll only be contacted if ${userName} misses their goals for 2+ consecutive days
‚Ä¢ We'll ask you to send a quick check-in message (like "Hey, how are you doing?")
‚Ä¢ You'll also get notified when they hit major milestones (7, 30, 60 day streaks) so you can celebrate with them!

üì± HOW IT WORKS:
‚Ä¢ Day 1 missed: Our team reaches out to ${userName} with encouragement
‚Ä¢ Day 2 missed: You get a notification asking you to check in
‚Ä¢ Day 3+ missed: We may ask multiple Emergency Support Team members to help

üîí YOUR PRIVACY:
‚Ä¢ We only share ${userName}'s goal progress, never personal details
‚Ä¢ You can opt out anytime by replying to any message
‚Ä¢ We typically contact Emergency Support Team members 1-2 times per month maximum

üí™ WHY THIS WORKS:
People are 90% more likely to achieve their goals when they have social accountability. Your support could be the difference between ${userName} succeeding or giving up.

GIVE CONSENT:
${consentUrl}

If you'd prefer not to participate, that's completely okay! Just ignore this message and we won't contact you again.

Thanks for being someone ${userName} trusts and cares about! ‚ù§Ô∏è

‚úÖ We'll celebrate their wins with you when they hit major milestones
‚úÖ Your support will help them achieve a 90%+ success rate

You can opt out anytime by replying to any message from us.
